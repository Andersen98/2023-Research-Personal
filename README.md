# 2023-Research-Personal

A list of my strengths, weaknesses, and interests in research.

## Weaknesses

The following are instances where I noticed things did not go well in my research with my previous group.

- Tendency to add features before making a well tested and working simplest case implementation
- Got distracted on side projects or non-essential problems
- I found "un-structured" collaboration such as casually asking group members for help or advice to be emotionally taxing. This took away from my ability to focus on research.
- Difficulty in knowing appropriate levels of detail when asked to do task by advisor.
- I struggled with finishing my project/did not finish my main project.
  - I did the "hard work" of implimenting the individual parts of my project, but I was not able to finish the last organizational step where the peices come together and are delivered as a final code.

## Strengths

I am chosing to organize my strengths into technical skills and investigation/research strengths.

### Investigation/Research Strengths

- When tasked with learning Density Functional Theory software, I went to my labmates for help/advice rather than trying to tackle the problem alone.
- When talking with my advisor or labmates, I practice active listening. This is where I repeat back a paraphrased summary of what was just said. Doing so alleviates many miscommunications immediately.
- I organized weekly meetings with my collaborators where I presented my research progress/listen to the colaborators experimental progress.
- I set up individual meetings with the grad student who was running my collaborator's experiment. Through these, I gained a thorough understanding of the experimental setup and relevant needs for me as a theorist. 
- I did well with structured collaboration, where I reached out to collaborators and roomates to setup meetings.

### Technical Strengths

My main technical strengths are:

1. Computer Systems
2. Physics
3. General Software Development
4. Applied Mathematics

#### Computer Systems

- Intimate familiarity with the compilation process for C and C++. This includes symbol lookups in shared libraries and how these are looked up on linux systems when running programs.
- I contributed a cleaner build procedure for a labmates C++ project. This procedure was adopted and used going forward in his code's build instructions.
- I was able to debug my project's C++ code using command line


#### General Software Development

- My main experience is in python and C++ development.

## Interests

In general, I am interested in the formalization of physical phenomena such that they are able to be represented and handled on computers.
